# üó∫Ô∏è Cloud GeoIP via DNS Test Tool

*Hey clouds, where do your DNS servers think I am?*

Make sure that your ISP's DNS server or a third-party DNS server is returning the correct results from popular cloud providers via DNS-based geolocation.

While this tool isn‚Äôt comprehensive‚Äîservices can use many other geolocation methods or route traffic differently using non-DNS methods such as Anycast‚Äîit is specifically designed to test DNS-based GeoIP routing. DNS-based GeoIP routing works by directing users to region-specific servers based on their IP address as resolved through DNS queries. However, some services use Anycast, a networking technique where the same IP address is advertised from multiple geographic locations, allowing traffic to be routed dynamically to the nearest server based on network topology rather than DNS. Additionally, services may rely on application-level geolocation, such as using a client‚Äôs public IP address after a connection is established, to make routing decisions. Despite these complexities, this tool focuses on DNS-based mechanisms, which can still provide valuable insights when diagnosing issues like high latency or unexpected regional behaviors.

This tool is made up of:

* Cloud configuration via Pulumi to configure popular cloud providers to use GeoIP routing in their DNS offerings for you to test against. This part is mainly for transparency, showing how DNS records are set up. I've already set up the infrastructure for you which you can test against.
* A simple guide on how to use the `dig` or PowerShell cmdlet to query a CNAME record with geo-routing. This part is for you.

The rest of this README explains how to use the infrastructure set up to test DNS-based GeoIP routing.

## Prerequisites

You‚Äôll need a Linux, Mac, or Windows desktop or laptop with access to a terminal or PowerShell.

Unfortunately, testing from a mobile device or game console isn‚Äôt currently feasible here without significant cost.

### Linux/macOS

Ensure `dig` is installed on your system. It‚Äôs part of the `dnsutils` package on most Linux distributions. On macOS, it‚Äôs included by default.

To install on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsutils
```

To install on Red Hat:

```bash
sudo dnf install bind-utils
```

### Windows

Modern Windows has PowerShell installed. You can use the `Resolve-DnsName` cmdlet to query DNS records. Open PowerShell by searching for it in the Start menu.

## Testing

This ‚Äútool‚Äù works by querying a domain name that can return different responses based on where you‚Äôre resolving from. The tool tests GeoIP via DNS. It does not test via HTTP or non-DNS.

### Pick a Domain

First, pick the domain(s) you want to query based on the cloud provider you want to test against. I suggest testing all the major cloud providers.

For Azure and AWS, test against the continent-determining domain first to see if it recognizes your continent. Then, use the continent-specific domains to see if it can pinpoint your location more accurately.

Here are the domains and notes:

* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
  * Note: GCP‚Äôs DNS GeoIP is less granular compared to Azure and AWS. It typically has a few regions tied to Google's datacenter locations.
  * `test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
* **Azure**
  * Note: Azure has extremely fine-grained DNS GeoIP. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt combine all options into a single domain because there‚Äôs a maximum of 200 routing options per ‚Äútraffic manager profile.‚Äù For Azure tests, you need the correct domain name for the continent you‚Äôre testing from.
  * **Continent**
    * `world-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Africa**
    * `geo-af-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Antarctica (Hi! üêß)**
    * `geo-an-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Asia**
    * `geo-as-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Asia Pacific**
    * `geo-ap-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Europe**
    * `geo-eu-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **Middle East**
    * `geo-me-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **North America**
    * `geo-na-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
  * **South America**
    * `geo-sa-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net`
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
  * Note: AWS also has highly granular DNS GeoIP. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt combine all options into a single domain for testing because there‚Äôs a maximum of 100 routing options per Hosted Zone. For AWS tests, you need the correct domain name for the continent you‚Äôre testing from.
  * **Continent**
    * `test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **Africa**
    * `test.af-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **Asia**
    * `test.as-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **Europe**
    * `test.eu-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **Oceania**
    * `test.oc-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **North America**
    * `test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **South America**
    * `test.sa-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`
  * **Antarctica is omited for cost savings**

### Query the CNAME Record for the Domain

For example, to query the CNAME record for `test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`, replace it with whichever domain you wish to test.

### Linux/macOS

```bash
dig CNAME test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
```

Example output:

```
nelson@Mac ~ % dig CNAME test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> CNAME test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

nelson@Mac ~ %
```

### Windows

```powershell
Resolve-DnsName -Name test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com -Type CNAME
```

Example output:

```
PS C:\Users\Nelson> Resolve-DnsName -Name test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com -Type CNAME

Name                           Type   TTL   Section    NameHost

test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes CNAME  60    Answer     test-result-us-west2.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
.com


PS C:\Users\Nelson>
```

## Understanding the Output

The output shows the CNAME record that was resolved. This record points to a domain associated with the region the DNS GeoIP system believes you‚Äôre closest to. In the example above, the record points to `test-result-us-west2.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`, indicating GeoIP sees you as nearest to the `us-west2` region in Google Cloud Platform. Google Cloud regions can be found [on their site along with the "machine" name for the region](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations).

Below is an Azure example. Azure‚Äôs GeoIP can be more fine-grained than GCP‚Äôs:

Mac/Linux:
```
nelson@Mac ~ % dig CNAME geo-na-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> CNAME geo-na-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net
;; global options: +cmd

```

Windows:
```
PS C:\Users\Nelson> Resolve-DnsName -Name geo-na-geoip-test.trafficmanager.net -Type CNAME

Name                           Type   TTL   Section    NameHost
----                           ----   ---   -------    --------
geo-na-geoip-test.trafficmanag CNAME  0     Answer     test-result-us-ca.azure.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
er.net


PS C:\Users\Nelson>
```

As you can see, it resolves to `test-result-us-ca.azure.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`, suggesting GeoIP thinks you‚Äôre near `us-ca` (California). You can find region code mappings in the [./azure-geo-code-list.ts](./azure-geo-code-list.ts) file.

Now, an AWS example:

Mac/Linux:
```
nelson@Mac ~ % dig CNAME test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> CNAME test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 109

nelson@Mac ~ %
```

Windows:
```
PS C:\Users\Nelson> Resolve-DnsName -Name test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com -Type CNAME

Name                           Type   TTL   Section    NameHost
----                           ----   ---   -------    --------
test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-t CNAME  60    Answer     test-result-us-ca.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
est.mindflakes.com


PS C:\Users\Nelson>
```

Here it points to `test-result-us-ca.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com`, indicating you‚Äôre near the `us-ca` region in AWS. If needed, refer to the [./aws-geo-code-list.ts](./aws-geo-code-list.ts) file for code mappings.

Sometimes you‚Äôll see a CNAME that indicates a GeoIP error or fallback. Below is a sample from a GCP Paris VM testing the AWS North America domain:

```
crazysim@instance-20250103-215639:~$ dig CNAME test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com

; <<>> DiG 9.18.28-1~deb12u2-Debian <<>> CNAME test.na-geoip-test.aws.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 43922
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

;; WHEN: Fri Jan 03 21:58:24 UTC 2025
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 139

crazysim@instance-20250103-215639:~$
```

If you encounter this, ensure you‚Äôre testing from within the intended continent. It might also be an actual bug in the DNS GeoIP routing system.

## Tips for Testing

### Test against Different DNS Servers

You can test against different DNS servers with `dig` or `Resolve-DnsName` from the system configuration. This can help you see how different DNS servers resolve the same domain.

For example, to test against Google‚Äôs public DNS servers on Linux/macOS or Windows:

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 CNAME test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com
```

```powershell
Resolve-DnsName -Name test.gcp.geoip-test.mindflakes.com -Type CNAME -Server 8.8.8.8
```

## Pitfalls

* **DNS Caching**: DNS records may be cached by your ISP, local network, or computer. If you see unexpected results, try flushing your DNS cache or waiting a few minutes.
  * Flushing DNS Cache on Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
  * Flushing DNS Cache on macOS: `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
  * Flushing DNS Cache on Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`
  * These commands can vary by system; consult your documentation.
* **VPN**: If you‚Äôre using a VPN, the GeoIP system will see you as being in the VPN server‚Äôs location. This can be useful for testing but may yield misleading results if you‚Äôre not trying to appear in that location.
* **DNS not coming out of your normal traffic route**: It's possible for DNS to take a different route to the internet than your non-DNS traffic. This may affect results.
* **It‚Äôs not perfect**: DNS-based GeoIP routing is just one of many methods that services use to determine your location. It‚Äôs not always accurate and can be affected by factors like IP block reassignment and slow database updates.

## Development

This is a simple Pulumi project specific to my setup that sets up DNS records for GeoIP routing tests. I run `pulumi up` to deploy the infrastructure on my own cloud account. I needed Pulumi installed and configured with multiple cloud providers‚Äô credentials. The estimated cost to run this was about $(0.25+0.50*7)/month, since Google and AWS charges per zone. Other providers charge by query, which should be minimal. We don‚Äôt need extra features like monitoring for this test.

edit: this cost too much on azure. Just use this temporaily.

I don‚Äôt expect most people to fork/run this themselves, but I‚Äôm providing the code for transparency. Feel free to fork or reference it if needed for your own specific testing or scenario.

## Trivia and Observations

* Azure has a proper geographical heirarchy for GeoIP routing, with continent, region, and country options. It even has provinces for Canada, Australia, and states for the US.
* AWS is relatively flat and only has subregions for the US states and **Ukraine**'s oblasts. Continental division for the source data had to be enriched from AI. There are no subregions for Canada or Australia. I‚Äôm not sure why Ukraine is singled out but it might due to the conflict with Russia and the need for granularity.
* AWS has more "countries" for Antarctica than Azure. Azure has one, while AWS has three. For cost reasons, I am not setting up AWS testing against Antarctica though.

## Useful Tools
